      <h3>Learn more about our initiative.</h3>
      <p>Our mission here at the GWUCUI is to strengthen the GW community by helping students and alumni bank cheaply,
       build credit, better manage their finances and develop valuable skill sets that they can bring to their careers. 
       We seek to accomplish this goal by chartering a student-run Credit Union. A credit union is essentially a 
       not-for-profit bank. This allows us to not only offer small loans with low rates, but also pay higher interest on member deposits! 
       In addition to banking services, we will offer a unique credit building program that builds 
       credit score and knowledge of finances. All these services aim to empower the GW community while also providing job 
       experience for GW students interested in any field.</p><br>

      <h3>We're developing a free curriculum for students.</h3>
      <p>We aim to solve a critical problem that our peers face: a lack of financial literacy education and training to manage their personal finances. Fellow GW undergraduate and graduate students have told us they feel underprepared for the transition to financial independence after graduation. A lack of financial literacy follows into adulthood, affecting the ability to plan and sustainably spend. We have already hosted events and are now working with partners on campus to develop a curriculum around financial literacy. These resources will help students understand their personal finances and utilize our products.</p><br>

      Kennedy is the new CFO of SecurityPlus.   He started his credit union career as CFO at Department of Justice FCU, after 
      working as Senior Accountant at the FSLIC Receivership Division under Mr. William Linane Sr. who encouraged him to bring 
      his talents to credit unions when the FSLIC Division was moving to Atlanta. At the time Mr. Linane was also HUDFCU 
      Chairman and a Board member at Cap Corp.  
      
      Bill’s credit union career since then has mainly been in credit union turnaround situations. Because of his strong 
      leadership, turnaround skills and his overall extensive involvement in the community he was honored and recognized with 
      the NAFCU Professional CEO of the Year and the Judith A. Burgin Memorial Professional of the Year Award’s and the 2019 
      Credit Union Rock Star Award.  
      
      Nationally and locally, he is heavily involved in giving back to the credit union movement and community at large.  He is 
      the founder and for six years, until 2019, directed the quarterly Mid Atlantic Finance and Accounting events held at the 
      Association.  Other past experience includes being elected by CFO peers to two separate terms on the CUNA CFO Executive 
      Board; ten years of full and part time College Business Faculty, NJ CU Foundation Board, Police Athletic League Board 
      member/Treasurer, Argyle Country Club Board member/Treasurer, Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA) Camp and Huddle 
      leader, Board member of Maryland Credit Union League, and Board member/ Treasurer of National Capital Central FCU, CUNA 
      Mutual CEO Select Group, a MACUMA Board member and an advisor to the George Washington Credit Union startup initiative.   
      
      Bill is passionate about bringing recent college graduates and current college students into the movement. As business 
      faculty it disappointed him that students did not have a credit union career on their radar. He set about to change that 
      by offering internships whenever possible , and to date he has mentored over 80 college interns, many who entered and 
      remain involved in the movement.  
      
      Bill a CCUE and NCCO, holds an MBA through the Executive Program at Loyola College, additional Masters Level Accounting 
      courses from Liberty University, and a Bachelor of Science in Business and Accounting from the University of Maryland, 
      College Park.
      
      Bill and his wife Ann live in Frederick, Maryland. During his free time Bill enjoys golf with his adult children, serving 
      the FCA, and is itching to get golf clubs in the hands of his five grandchildren.">
